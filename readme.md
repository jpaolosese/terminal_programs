# terminal_programs
Small terminal programs in Python I made for quick temperature/distance unit conversion/calculations 

Calculation programs that use Newton's method such as square_root.py and cube_root.py will also print calculation logs.

Run in terminal like you would any other program:
```bash
$ python3 <program name> [args]
```
For example:

```bash
$ python3 square_root.py 912.04
```
Output:

```bash
Square root of 912.04 = 456.52. Error = 426.32
Square root of 912.04 = 229.2589047577324. Error = 199.05890475773242
Square root of 912.04 = 116.61855723166089. Error = 86.41855723166088
Square root of 912.04 = 62.219633972861004. Error = 32.019633972861
Square root of 912.04 = 38.43901471521989. Error = 8.239014715219891
Square root of 912.04 = 31.082974810625572. Error = 0.8829748106255728
Square root of 912.04 = 30.212541343306896. Error = 0.01254134330689638
Square root of 912.04 = 30.20000260298017. Error = 2.60298017096261e-06
Square root of 912.04 = 30.20000000000011. Error = 1.1013412404281553e-13
Square root of 912.04 = 30.2. Error = 0.0
Comparison with math module:
Square root of 912.04 = 30.2. guess^2 = 912.04
```

It all seems harmless.
